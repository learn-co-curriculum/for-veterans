# For Veterans

The pressures and difficulties of everyday civilian life are completely different than those associated with military employment and it takes time to get used to “the new normal.” Transitioning out of the service, being back with family and trying to find a suitable career can cause stress and anxiety for any veteran.

Rather than have a “the grass is greener” perception of civilian versus military work life, with one being easier than the other, as General Petraeus said: “The reality is that one has to truly commit fully to succeed in uniform and also to succeed in civilian pursuits. Life is a competitive endeavor, whether that life is in uniform or in the civilian world.”

Military jobs can be difficult to transfer into the civilian world. However, those who have served developed the following military values, which will be very useful to you and highly sought after in the job market. Some military values that translate to civilian jobs:

- Punctuality
- Integrity
- Understanding Chain of Command
- Team work
- Strong work ethic

Though you may be feeling incredible pressure right now to obtain a job, you must take good care of yourself to succeed at this goal.  From time to time, everyone experiences situations that affect their general well-being. Flatiron School recognizes this and as a result, has introduced a [Student Assistance Program] (https://www.advantageengagement.com/1006/login_company_global.php) **(loggin code: flatiron)** to help all students be more successful at meeting their responsibilities at home and school, whether you are learning online or on campus.  

Key benefits include: 
- No cost to you - the service is paid for by Flatiron School.
- Available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. At any time of the day or night, weekends, and over holidays, you will be able to speak to a professional.
- You have access to 3 counseling sessions per issue per year.
- Confidential. No one at Flatiron School will know that you have called unless you choose to disclose this.
- Independent, impartial source of support. Your Student Assistance Program is completely independent and does not represent any organization, including Flatiron School. 

The Student Assistance Program can provide support on a wide range of issues, including improving relationships, parenting,
couples’ support, managing stress & life changes, surviving the loss of a loved one, improving esteem and confidence
and referrals to local financial or legal resources. These benefits and services are available to you throughout your student journey, from acceptance into the school until you complete and/or exit career services or you withdraw from the school.   

In addition to contacting the service via telephone, you can also access information and support via texting, emailing and online chat.
